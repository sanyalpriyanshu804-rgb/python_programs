Welcome to my Python practice repository!
This repo contains simple, beginner-level Python scripts and mini-projects that I create while learning and experimenting with Python programming.

The goal of this repository is to track my progress, improve my coding skills, and build a solid foundation in Python—one small project at a time

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
# Practice Python regularly
# Document my learning journey
# Keep my code organized
# Improve readability and coding style
# Share simple examples with other beginners

🤝 Contributions
# Since this is mainly a learning repo, contributions are optional—but if you’d like to improve or suggest something, feel free to:
# Open an issue
# Submit a pull request
# Suggest beginner-friendly project ideas

📌 Future Plans
# Add more structured projects
# Improve documentation
# Explore modules, OOP, and APIs
# Start using virtual environments and learn about AI
